This little google maps module is designed to make adding directions to an address as easy as possible to include.

It's included as a basic thin/sinatra app but it's javascript so it should work in most places.

RUNNING EXAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS

1. git clone this repo

2. cd /*insert dir name here*/

3. thin start

4. Open your browser at localhost:3000


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make sure that the f65-gmap.js file is on your server.

2. Make sure that jquery is included and active in your document.

3. Include the google maps api in the head of your document.

4. Include a div element a bit like this: "<div id="google-directions" data-endpoint="IP1 3BZ" data-placeholder="enter postcode" data-link-text="get directions" data-directions="true" data-map="true"></div>".

5. Check to make sure the attributes of this div match your preferences (see below).
	data-endpoint : the endpoint postcode of your journey.
	data-placeholder : the placeholder text for the textfield.
	data-link-text : the text inside the activation link.
	data-directions : true or false depending if you want directions included.
	data-map : true or false depending if you want a map included.

6. Make sure you style the elements accordingly. Below is an example of some SASS generated CSS for the various elements.

div#google-directions {
  width: 300px;
  padding: 5px;
  background: #ccc; }
  div#google-directions div.gmap-section {
    margin-top: 5px;
    padding: 5px;
    display: none;
    background: #efefef; }
    div#google-directions div.gmap-section#controls {
      margin-top: 0;
      display: block; }
      div#google-directions div.gmap-section#controls input.text {
        padding: 5px;
        margin-right: 5px; }
      div#google-directions div.gmap-section#controls a.get-directions {
        color: #fff;
        background: #ccc;
        padding: 5px 7px;
        text-decoration: none; }
        div#google-directions div.gmap-section#controls a.get-directions:hover {
          background: #333; }
    div#google-directions div.gmap-section#map {
      height: 300px; }
